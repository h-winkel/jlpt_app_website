    <h2>About Benkyo Buddy</h2>
    <p>Benkyo Buddy is a comprehensive Japanese learning app designed for steady, daily practice. It is based on real experience learning Japanese over many years — not on short-term hacks. The goal is not to be the fastest method, but to provide all the tools needed to actually maintain long-term progress, every day.</p>
    
    <h3>Spaced-Repetition Vocabulary Practice</h3>
    <p>Benkyo Buddy includes SRS flashcards for over 9,000 words, ordered by JLPT level and part of speech. Each entry comes with example sentences and audio generated with Google’s current Text-to-Speech engine.</p>
    
    <h3>Kanji Drawing & Mnemonics</h3>
    <p>For every vocabulary item, users can draw each kanji directly in the app, and optionally write their own mnemonic story for each character. Built-in kanji and radical lists show meanings at a glance.</p>
    
    <h3>Grammar Practice & Reference</h3>
    <p>The app includes over 700 grammar points, which unlock as you learn relevant vocabulary. Six exercise types help internalize each grammar point:
<br><br>
・Starred blanks (insert the missing word)
<br>
・Sentence word ordering
<br>
・Conjugation exercises
<br>
・Translation (JP ↔ EN)
<br>
・Particle fill-in
<br>
・Verb transitivity identification
<br><br>
Every grammar point also doubles as a reference entry you can browse.</p>
        
    <h3>Listening Practice</h3>
    <p>The app plays a Japanese sentence and you reproduce it by ordering the words correctly.</p>
        
    <h3>Built-In “Ask the Developer” Forum</h3>
    <p>A small forum is included where users can give feedback, request features, and ask questions about the app’s direction.</p>
        
    <h3>Use Across Multiple Devices</h3>
    <p>Your progress can be synced between devices — learn anywhere.</p>
        
    <h3>Search Vocabulary, Grammar, Kanji</h3>
    <p>A unified search screen allows you to look up any entry you’ve learned (or reset entries you’d like to relearn).</p>
        
    <h3>Free N5 Tier (No Registration Required)</h3>
    <p>Try the app from JLPT N5 entirely offline — no account needed.
(N5 Free Mode does not include the forum, settings, or statistics screens.)</p>
